abstract = """In this session, we’ll walk through the five steps to transformational change that I’ve found to be important. These are really applicable to any continuously improving organization or any large amount of change in a system.

Establish the vision; Create shared experiences; Educate, educate, educate; Find evangelists; Get feedback.

I’ll elaborate on each item with methods I’ve used in real transformations at multiple companies. I’ll also describe how these all tie into the devops culture, which is really the transformation that’s occurring within the company.
